This project demonstrates expertise in data acquisition (web scraping, Graph API), data cleaning, data analysis (Python, NLP, Topic Modeling, Sentiment Analysis), and strategic planning (communication strategy formulation). We highlight the paramount influence of social media on its hundreds of millions of users worldwide. The project also underscores the significance of leveraging social media data to inform governmental communication strategies during times of war, thereby contributing to effective digital diplomacy.

### Project Description:  
This research project aims to understand the influence of social media on the Ukraine-Russia war. We collaborated with the Taiwan Digital Diplomacy Association and Meta to collect data from 200,000+ posts on Facebook, Telegram, and Twitter from officials like Ukraine President “Volodymyr Zelenskyy,” the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, international administrative bodies, and local newspapers through web scrapping, Graph API, and data cleaning. We analyzed public response, sentimental behavior, and trend creation on social media platforms through Natural Language Processing (NLP), which included Topic Modeling and Sentiment Analysis (Python). The goal was to gauge the impact of these social media posts on over 500,000 Ukrainians and the international community, particularly regarding their sentiments and reactions to the ongoing war.

We used the Kaggle Dataset about the Ukraine-Russia war. We also scraped data from Ukrainian government officials' Twitter and Facebook accounts to analyze the factors leading to viral posts on the given topic. This includes an analysis of posts' exact wording, sentiment analysis, and activity correlation with the location and time. We focus on which words or combination of words lead to the most activity, the most frequent words used by the Ukrainian officials, the most salient words from President Zelenskyy's and President Donald Trump's tweets, and word co-occurrences in posts related to the war. The aim is to understand the contributing factors to a tweet's popularity.

### Results
The results showed that most tweets expressed condolences and support, with the highest tweet density from users in the US, Ukraine, and Iran. Insights from this analysis were used to formulate a guidance proposal for the government of Taiwan on strategies for effective digital communication with Taiwanese citizens. Recommendations focused on tailoring digital communication strategies based on a nuanced understanding of public sentiments and reactions in real-time, enhancing the effectiveness of governmental communication with citizens, especially during critical times.
